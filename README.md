# Analysis of College Enrollment Trends
## Executive Summary
This project will look at U.S. College Scorecard data from the Department of Education. The main objective is to examine the relationship between various variables and college enrollment and graduation rates for both 2-year and 4-year degree programs.  

## Motivation
The high cost of college and its impact on individualâ€™s job prospects and overall life outlook make this an important and interesting topic to explore. Examining the data on college enrollment and graduation rates may help identify trends that can understand the factors that influence college graduation. This is also an interesting topic to explore since the ongoing debate about student loan forgiveness has sparked questions about college affordability and if that is associated with the decline in enrollment.  Additionally, I am interested in this topic as an instructor as it is important for me to see students succeed in their courses and finish college. 

## Data Question
The data question is how college enrollment and graduation rates vary among factors such as the state, area of study, availability of jobs for graduates, financial aid, and student demographics. 
A study by Edge Research and HCM Strategists Where are the Students? states that some of the factors associated with the decline in enrollment include concerns about the financial returns of college education and availability of education options that are different from traditional college degrees. 

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The minimum viable product (MVP) will include chart of trend in college enrollment and graduation rate across years. It will also include graphs showing the relationship between the variables that are found to be most influential on graduation rate and graduation rate. The intended audience for this project is the general public. 


## Data Sources
The data that will be used is the College Scorecard data from [collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) 

## Known Issues and Challenges
The dataset contains a large number of fields, so it may be challenging to narrow down to a few fields to focus on for the project. My approach is to manage this is to dedicate some time to do exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between the different fields to identify the variables that may be most important for the project.
